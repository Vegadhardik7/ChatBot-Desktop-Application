# MYChat (ChatBot Application For Colleges)
MYChat is a chatBot application which was created to make the conversation between parents/students and college staffs more smoother, easier, and efficient. With MYChat parents will get answers to their quieres easily and they dont have to call into the college office again and again, which is kinda frustating because the college staffs cant be available 24x7 for everyone.

MYChat not only take texts as a input but it can also take audio as an input from the user and can even give you answer in audio format too.

In MYChat I have added a commen list of questions which I collected from our colleges query box and put them into the (List of questions you may ask) list.
This helped the user as well as the college staff by saving their time and enery that they spend to call and have a conversation.

<b>The special thing about MYChat is that, suppose the user is not satisfy with the answer which he/she received from the bot, he/she can put that question into (Help us to Advance, Enter your unanswered Query) section, once the unanswered query is send by the user it will automatically get appended in the unanswered query file which the college management will keep on checking and than they can update/answer that unsolved query.</b>
